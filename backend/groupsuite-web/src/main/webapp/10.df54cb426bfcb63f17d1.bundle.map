The arguments passed to this function are:\n\t * - `outerValue`: the value that came from the source\n\t * - `innerValue`: the value that came from the projected Observable\n\t * - `outerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value that came from the source\n\t * - `innerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value from the projected Observable\n\t * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n\t * projection function (and the optional `resultSelector`) to each item emitted\n\t * by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n\t * projected inner Observable.\n\t * @method switchMap\n\t * @owner Observable\n\t */\n\tfunction switchMap(project, resultSelector) {\n\t    return this.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector));\n\t}\n\texports.switchMap = switchMap;\n\tvar SwitchMapOperator = (function () {\n\t    function SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector) {\n\t        this.project = project;\n\t        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n\t    }\n\t    SwitchMapOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n\t        return source._subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project, this.resultSelector));\n\t    };\n\t    return SwitchMapOperator;\n\t}());\n\t/**\n\t * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n\t * @ignore\n\t * @extends {Ignored}\n\t */\n\tvar SwitchMapSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n\t    __extends(SwitchMapSubscriber, _super);\n\t    function SwitchMapSubscriber(destination, project, resultSelector) {\n\t        _super.call(this, destination);\n\t        this.project = project;\n\t        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n\t        this.index = 0;\n\t    }\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n\t        var result;\n\t        var index = this.index++;\n\t        try {\n\t            result = this.project(value, index);\n\t        }\n\t        catch (error) {\n\t            this.destination.error(error);\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t        this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._innerSub = function (result, value, index) {\n\t        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n\t        if (innerSubscription) {\n\t            innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n\t        }\n\t        this.add(this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult_1.subscribeToResult(this, result, value, index));\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n\t        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n\t        if (!innerSubscription || innerSubscription.isUnsubscribed) {\n\t            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._unsubscribe = function () {\n\t        this.innerSubscription = null;\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyComplete = function (innerSub) {\n\t        this.remove(innerSub);\n\t        this.innerSubscription = null;\n\t        if (this.isStopped) {\n\t            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex, innerSub) {\n\t        if (this.resultSelector) {\n\t            this._tryNotifyNext(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n\t        }\n\t        else {\n\t            this.destination.next(innerValue);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._tryNotifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) {\n\t        var result;\n\t        try {\n\t            result = this.resultSelector(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n\t        }\n\t        catch (err) {\n\t            this.destination.error(err);\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t        this.destination.next(result);\n\t    };\n\t    return SwitchMapSubscriber;\n\t}(OuterSubscriber_1.OuterSubscriber));\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=switchMap.js.map\n\n/***/ },\n/* 915 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n\t    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n\t    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n\t    d.prototype = b === null ?

The arguments passed to this function are:\n * - `outerValue`: the value that came from the source\n * - `innerValue`: the value that came from the projected Observable\n * - `outerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value that came from the source\n * - `innerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value from the projected Observable\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n * projection function (and the optional `resultSelector`) to each item emitted\n * by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n * projected inner Observable.\n * @method switchMap\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction switchMap(project, resultSelector) {\n    return this.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector));\n}\nexports.switchMap = switchMap;\nvar SwitchMapOperator = (function () {\n    function SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector) {\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n    }\n    SwitchMapOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source._subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project, this.resultSelector));\n    };\n    return SwitchMapOperator;\n}());\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar SwitchMapSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(SwitchMapSubscriber, _super);\n    function SwitchMapSubscriber(destination, project, resultSelector) {\n        _super.call(this, destination);\n        this.project = project;\n        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n        this.index = 0;\n    }\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        var result;\n        var index = this.index++;\n        try {\n            result = this.project(value, index);\n        }\n        catch (error) {\n            this.destination.error(error);\n            return;\n        }\n        this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._innerSub = function (result, value, index) {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (innerSubscription) {\n            innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n        }\n        this.add(this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult_1.subscribeToResult(this, result, value, index));\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n        if (!innerSubscription || innerSubscription.isUnsubscribed) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._unsubscribe = function () {\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyComplete = function (innerSub) {\n        this.remove(innerSub);\n        this.innerSubscription = null;\n        if (this.isStopped) {\n            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex, innerSub) {\n        if (this.resultSelector) {\n            this._tryNotifyNext(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        else {\n            this.destination.next(innerValue);\n        }\n    };\n    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._tryNotifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) {\n        var result;\n        try {\n            result = this.resultSelector(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n        }\n        catch (err) {\n            this.destination.error(err);\n            return;\n        }\n        this.destination.next(result);\n    };\n    return SwitchMapSubscriber;\n}(OuterSubscriber_1.OuterSubscriber));\n//# sourceMappingURL=switchMap.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/operator/switchMap.js\n// module id = 914\n// module chunks = 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 18","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?
